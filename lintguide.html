<h2>WMLLINT ERROR MESSAGES</h2>

<p>wmllint is one of the most powerful aids to authors of Wesnoth campaigns, eras, and other content. It is well-known as a porting utility, automatically doing most of the work of converting old campaigns and content to the latest version of Wesnoth. But it is a general purpose debugging tool, alerting authors and porters to possible errors in their WML (Wesnoth Markup Language).

<p>Unfortunately, it is not always apparent to someone new to WML what to do about wmllint's error messages. What do they mean, which are real problems, and which are false alarms? This guide aims to explain these errors, illustrated with real examples.

<h3>EXIT ERRORS</h3>



<h4>unknown 'Name' referred to by id</h4>

<p>This can be a valuable message alerting you to misspelled names, or characters that the designer forgot to create or recall. Unfortunately, it is prone to high false positives, because it doesn't recognize units created or recalled by macros.

<!-- I HAVE A MUCH BETTER WAY OF HANDLING THIS NOW

<p>The following set of commands cuts down on these false positives by excluding those that are mentioned in macros. In this example, wmllint output was directed to a file called "lintlog".

<p><pre>grep "referred to by id" lintlog|sed "s;^\"\([^\"]*\).*\(line [0-9]\+:\) unknown .\(.*\). referred to by id;grep -wL \"{.*\3\" \1\|sed \"s,$, - \2 \3,\" >>idcheck;" >missingpersons.sh
chmod +x missingpersons.sh
./missingpersons.sh</pre>

<p>Now you can view "idcheck" in your preferred app.

<p>Although this will eliminate hits for units created or recalled by name in a macro, that does not mean that all the remaining hits in idcheck are bad. For instance, if the designer had grouped multiple units together in a single create/recall macro (say, {RECALL_HEROES} or {ELVISH_ALLIES_RETURN}), that would not be picked up above. Similarly, a unit's creation may be triggered by an event defined in /utils.

<p>For example, if a designer forgot to recall a unit, and then performed a {MODIFY_UNIT} on that unit, the above macro 

<pre>grep "referred to by id" lintlog|sed "s;^\"\([^\"]*\).*\(line [0-9]\+:\) unknown .\(.*\). referred to by id;grep -wH \"{.*\3\" \1\|sed \"s,$, - \2 \3,\" >>idmacrocheck;" >foundpersons.sh
chmod +x foundpersons.sh
./foundpersons.sh</pre>

<h4>illegal child of [if]</h4>

<p>Probably, the designer forgot to include [then] and [/then] after describing the triggering conditions.

<h4>unit speaks in his/her death event</h4>

<p>You can get away with ignoring this if you wish. The standard is that last words should be spoken in an event named "last breath" instead of "die". (From the prevalence of this error, it's obvious that many designers are unaware of this convention.) The difference is that "last breath" runs before the death animation plays, rather than after. If other things happen after the last words (endlevel, by itself, doesn't count), those should be split off into another event keyed to "die".

<p>But if you feel this is more trouble than it's worth to "correct," this is a purely aesthetic issue. The game will not crash, and there is no real functional difference to gameplay.

<p>(There could also be special cases, such as a character who has the power of resurrection, or lives on as a disembodied spirit or soul, where you actually would want him or her to speak after they die. In 1.10, you can use the special comments "# wmllint: deathcheck off" and "# wmllint: deathcheck on" to suppress the speech check.)

<h4>unit declaration without side attribute</h4>

<p>A unit has been <span color="red">created or recalled</span> without telling which side it's on. In 1.8, however, this has a major source of false positives. Units created during setup within the [side] tag are automatically considered part of that side. (As of 1.9, wmllint recognizes units created or recalled within a [side] tag, and no longer gives off this false positive.)

<p>There are also situations where Wesnoth will implicitly assume that a unit belongs to side 1, if no side is given. However, this behavior is deprecated, so if there is such a condition, you should go ahead and add a side=1 line.

<h4>[%unit_type] has unknown movement type</h4>
<h4>[%unit_type] has unknown race</h4>
<h4>unit [%unit_type] has no race</h4>
<h4>unit [%unit_type] has superfluous {SPECIAL_NOTES}</h4>



<h4>unit [%unit_type] is missing notes +%s</h4>

<p>Although the unit has a trait or ability, it does not have the special notes for that trait in its description. Simply copy the notes from the error message and paste it at the end of the unit's description= key.

<h4>unit [%unit_type] is missing traits %s</h4>

<p>Although the unit has the special notes for a trait or ability in its description, it does not actually possess that trait. The implication is that the developer should give the unit the missing trait.

<p>It is possible, however, that the designer did not intend for the unit to have the trait, and it is the note that is in error. This might happen, for example, if the designer copied over code from another unit to start off the file, and removed the trait but forgot to remove the note.

<p>Obviously, if you are the creator, you will know which was intended. If you are a maintainer or porter, you might want to ask the original designer, if possible.
